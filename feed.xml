First of all you need to download all .eot, .woff, .ttf and .svg files, then copy them onto your server and finally paste a CSS snippet. Sounds easy? Well it could be, if Google would actually provide any direct links to download these files and a customized CSS for self-hosting them. To fix this problem without using font generation services like Font Squirrel, I decided to publish a little service called google-webfonts-helper.</summary><content type="html" src="http://ranf.tl/2014/12/23/self-hosting-google-web-fonts/"></content><author><name>Mario Ranftl</name></author></entry><entry><title>Valgrind on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite</title><link href="http://ranf.tl/2014/11/28/valgrind-on-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite/"/><id>http://ranf.tl/2014/11/28/valgrind-on-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite/</id><updated>2014-12-11T17:04:57.000Z</updated><published>2014-11-28T00:00:00.000Z</published><summary>You want to hack with C and Valgrind on OS X 10.10 Yosemite? Well, you’ll definitely run into problems getting it for your very platform, as there is no official stable release out there yet. Consequentially these is no receipt for Homebrew (which is great anyways, get it!), hence you need to manually build that nifty tool  from the latest trunk SVN repository.</summary><content type="html" src="http://ranf.tl/2014/11/28/valgrind-on-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite/"></content><author><name>Mario Ranftl</name></author></entry><entry><title>Extracting Libs from a Node.js Project</title><link href="http://ranf.tl/2014/10/01/extracting-libs-from-a-node-js-project/"/><id>http://ranf.tl/2014/10/01/extracting-libs-from-a-node-js-project/</id><updated>2014-12-11T17:03:27.000Z</updated><published>2014-10-01T00:00:00.000Z</published><summary>As promised, lets break out my customized plugins I’ve used with metalsmith to build up this site.
