title: Permalinks suck

I'm feeling stuck with [metalsmith-permalinks](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-permalinks). It's either dismiss or eat this horrifying `relative` option. Even no seperation or filtering (maybe via [metalsmith-branch](https://github.com/ericgj/metalsmith-branch)?)...

But another generator? Anyway, probably staying with [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/)...
