Hello World! You are reading the first published note on this shiny new homepage. Currently everything feels a bit empty, but I hope I can fill things up with some useful information.

Out of curiosity I had to run a quick `git log --max-parents=0 HEAD` to see the initial commit date. I was stunned when I realized that I've started developing in the end of July. Time wents by so fast.

``` bash
$ git log --max-parents=0 HEAD
commit 431bb58894baa6d1590b4e27cc3d211f12fba5ac
Author: majodev
Date:   Wed Jul 23 22:29:33 2014 +0200

    initial commit
```

Anyways, I'm glad you are able to read this and maybe you'll find something useful here in the next few weeks. 

Have some feedback on the design or structure? Please leave a comment below or catch me up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/majodev).
