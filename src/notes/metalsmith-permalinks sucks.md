I'm feeling stuck with [metalsmith-permalinks](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-permalinks). It's either dismiss or eat this horrifying `relative` option. Even no seperation or filtering (maybe via [metalsmith-branch](https://github.com/ericgj/metalsmith-branch)?)...

But switching to another generator? Never, I'll probably stay with [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/)...
